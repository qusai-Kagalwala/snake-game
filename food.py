# FOOD MECHANICS EXPLANATION:
# Food appears as small colored circles at random locations
# When snake collides with food (distance < 15 pixels), food refreshes to new location
# Each new food item gets a random color for visual variety
# Food boundaries are set to keep items within the game area (Â±280 pixels)
